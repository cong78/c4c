# c4c

Here at C4C we want to show the power of platform thinking in a very simple and transparent way using as many tools and APIs that are freely available and creating value along the way. 
Our first three goals relate to the familiarization of:
* Demonstration of the power of APIs in our landscape
* PSD2 capability of european banks
* Cross OS app engineering tools like Flutter


The POC will have capabilities like:
* Authentication
* Pinch classifier based on transactions
* Monthly aggregations in the app of the end user
